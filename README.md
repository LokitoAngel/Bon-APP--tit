# Bonappetit

Bonappetit is a Flutter-based mobile application designed for young adults or university students living away from home. The app provides a practical way to discover, save, and organize basic, quick, and easy-to-prepare recipes, especially suitable for meal prepping and storing in containers (topers).

## Installation

To run the app locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bonappetit.git
cd bonappetit
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## About the Project
Below is a detailed explanation of how each screen in the project works:

1. Home Screen

This screen displays a series of food lists and suggestions, all separated by category (meals, desserts, vegan, meat-based, among others).

3. Search
   
The system allows two different search methods: the first is by name, and the second is based on ingredients you have at home, allowing you to search and add them to the list.
